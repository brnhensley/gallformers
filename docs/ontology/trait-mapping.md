## Summary

### Well-aligned categories
- **Cells/chambers**: Near-perfect alignment (monothalamous, polythalamous, free-rolling)
- **Detachable**: Good alignment with GallOnt adding semideciduous
- **Plant parts**: Good coverage with Plant Ontology terms

### Partially aligned categories
- **Shape**: ~5 direct matches out of 13 GF values; GallOnt has ~15 shapes GF lacks
- **Texture**: ~7 matches out of 24 GF values; GallOnt has ~15 textures GF lacks
- **Colors**: Basic colors align; GallOnt adds compound colors and color patterns
- **Forms**: 3 exact matches; most GF forms are practical field terms without ontology equivalents

### GF-unique categories
- **Alignment** (orientation on plant): Not modeled in GallOnt at all
- **Seasons**: GallOnt doesn't model phenology (Prior Lab uses month-level granularity)

### Major GallOnt concepts GF lacks entirely
- Attachment style (sessile/pedicellate)
- Spatial pattern as a distinct axis (solitary/clustered/confluent)
- Quantitative size measurements
- Internal structure as a separate category from walls
- Structural properties (fragility, opacity)
- Specialized structures (emergence hole, kapello, abscission/dehiscence zones, nectaries)
