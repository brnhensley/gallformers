# Oban Operations

Operational guide for Gallformers background jobs.

## Dashboard

The Oban Web dashboard is mounted at `/admin/jobs` and is protected by the normal admin pipeline.

Use it to:
- Inspect queue health and worker throughput
- View failed, retryable, cancelled, and completed jobs
- Retry or cancel individual jobs
- Confirm cron-enqueued jobs are appearing on schedule

## Queues

Gallformers currently runs these queues:

| Queue | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `default` | General background work |
| `extraction` | Source ingestion and other LLM-heavy jobs |
| `maintenance` | Scheduled maintenance such as analytics rollups |

## Scheduled Jobs

Current cron jobs:

| Schedule (UTC) | Worker | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| `0 7 * * *` | `Gallformers.Analytics.RollupWorker` | Roll up analytics through yesterday and prune old raw page views |

## First Checks During an Incident

1. Open `/admin/jobs` and filter by `retryable`, `discarded`, or the affected queue.
2. Check whether failures are isolated to one worker or all queues.
3. Inspect the latest job error and confirm whether it is application, database, or infrastructure related.
4. If jobs are stuck in `executing`, verify whether the machine restarted recently. Lifeline should rescue stale jobs automatically.

## Common Operations

### Retry a failed job

1. Open the job in `/admin/jobs`
2. Confirm the underlying issue is fixed
3. Use the dashboard retry action

### Verify the analytics rollup

1. Open `/admin/jobs`
2. Filter for `Gallformers.Analytics.RollupWorker`
3. Confirm the daily cron job ran after 07:00 UTC
4. If it failed, inspect the job error before retrying

## Notes

- Oban shares the main Ecto pool. Sustained queue failures may reflect database saturation rather than a worker bug.
- Job retention is seven days via `Oban.Plugins.Pruner`.
- Reindexer and Lifeline are enabled by default for routine maintenance and orphan recovery.
